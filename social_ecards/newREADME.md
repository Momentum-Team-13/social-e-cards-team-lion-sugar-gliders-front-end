# Team Lion Sugar Gliders Social E-Cards App (Lisa Williams & Carlos Tirado)

## Directions

Our Social E-Cards App is a form of social media that allows users to create accounts that they can then use to send personalized E-cards to other users on the App.

## Links
Our app is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed here:

https://lionsugarglidercards.netlify.app/seeprofile

## Installation

If accessing our app via local server first you will need to clone our remote repository and then run `npm install` within the social_ecards subfolder to install all dependencies. From there run `npm start` to launch the app. 

# To Begin:


If you are new to the app, click the link to create a username and password. Once you are in the database, you will just need to log in upon visiting. If you close the window, you will not be automatically be logged out.

Once you are logged in and authenticated as a user, you will have access to the navigation bar where you will have a variety of options as broad as seeing all of the cards on the app or as narrow as only seeing a specific card of a person you follow.

When creating a card, you have the option of chosing a kitten placeholder card image or uploading a custom image file.
