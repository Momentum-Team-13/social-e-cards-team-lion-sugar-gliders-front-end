questions?
- what does the mockoon do? what is the difference between that server and the npm runserver?

- authentication?

- how to push everything but my notes

- questions about what/how exactly to commit my branch

AUTHENTICATION:
make a post request to the  endpoint
in the body of the post request, we include JSON which includes 2 keys:
user name & password

in response, we should get a piece of JSON with one key that gives us an auth_token

cookies are a semi permanent place to stash information that live in key/value pairs that live on our personal browsers

after submitting a loginForm you receive back a sessionID (like a stamp on the hand at a show) (sessionID is in browser, auth_token is in API)

work on .catch()

staying "logged in" means your auth_token/sessionID stays the same

we set the auth_token as state

include errors from API ifError()

localStorage.setItem('highScore', highScore);

localStorage.setItem('token', <TOKEN>)

localStorage.getItem('token')

const isLoggedIn = username && token
if (! LoggedIn){
    return <loginForm setAuth={setAuth}/>

after receiving token:

this happens in App.js
const setAuth = (username, token) =>{
    setToken(token)
    setUsername(username)
}
we auth, setAuth (auth_token)

const handleLogout = () =>{
    axios.post(
        "URL", --> url argument
        {} --> empty object... this is for 
        {
            headers:{
                authorization: `Token ${token}`
            }
        }
    )
    .then(()=>
    setAuth('',null))
}
^ we have to include headers... we have to send the token when we log out and then it destroys the token
