- ask about how to set variables during map
- reformat the way timestamps appear
-how to see another users information if the only cards that are showing are cards that I've left
- pass params through useNavigate

- is there a place where i add an "are you sure" to catch the data... it seems that if i click "follow user" i automatically follow them
<!-- userpage -->
